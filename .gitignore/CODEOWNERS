# Anything in shell-scripts/ (NOT subdirectories) that is a *.sh file is owned by Mario's team (example of owning certain exts in a directory, nonrecursively)
/shell-scripts/*.sh @org-mushroom-kingdom/team-mario

# However, Peach's team should own the documentation for it (example of owning specific file)
/shell-scripts/info.txt @org-mushroom-kingdom/team-peach

# README is also owned by Peach's team (example of owning specific file at top-level)
README.md @org-mushroom-kingdom/team-peach

# This purposefully has tabs in it to better test string splitting logic in read-thru-codeowners.sh (example of recursively owning all files/folders in a directory)
