#Bblablabalba TODO: Explain more about CODEOWNERS

# Format: /path/to/file @username @org/team

# The order of the lines in this file is mostly in 'natural sort' order, where any path that begins with a character is earlier
# than alphabetical characters (ex. .github is the first thing because it begins with a . then .gitignore is next because it also
# begins with a period, but is alphabetically "later" than .github)


# ANY README is also owned by Peach's team (example of owning specific filename regardless of directory.)
# ** means match any directory/subdirectory. Since ** is being used at the top-level, it will look thru all folders in this repo for files named "README.md"
**/README.md @org-mushroom-kingdom/team-peach

/images/ @org-mushroom-kingdom/team-toad

# This purposefully has tabs in it to better test string splitting logic in read-thru-codeowners.sh (example of recursively owning all files/folders in a directory)
/org/      @org-mushroom-kingdom/team-luigi
# Anything in shell-scripts/ (NOT subdirectories) that is a *.sh file is owned by Mario's team (example of owning certain exts in a directory, nonrecursively)

/shell-scripts/*.sh @org-mushroom-kingdom/team-mario

# However, Peach's team should own the documentation for it (example of owning specific file)
/shell-scripts/info.txt @org-mushroom-kingdom/team-peach

# Toad's team owns this specific file
