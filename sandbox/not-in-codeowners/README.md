This folder structure exists to have something that specifically doesn't exist in CODEOWNERS, with files that don't really matter in it. There should be a smattering of files in the subfolders, with various extensions.  
  <!-- TODO: Alter this -->
<!-- Many of the files in the sandbox/other directory and its subfolders begin with "dummy"   -->
<!-- The hint is in the name: They're dummy files, whose text will more or less state they are dummy files and where they are located.  -->
<!--   
Some files won't begin with 'dummy' but may serve the same purpos; their name should reflect their purpose/representation. For example, this repo doesn't interact with Jenkins at all, but there is a Jenkinsfile in ```sandbox/other/sub2/```. If you checked its contents, you'll see the same sort of message you would in a dummy file.  -->
