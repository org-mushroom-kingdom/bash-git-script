# This represents an extensionless file in a directory. Essentially a dummy file without having dummy in the name 

# Really savegame files are for games, but it was difficult to think of a real-word extensionless file whose naming isn't super strict.
# Thinking back I could just name stuff like this extensionlessFile1, extensionlessFile2 or something because what if those were my propreitary file types?
# But I like games so this works out
