  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  # 8-28-25: These should probably be commented back in at some point, but I'm doing PR related testing and this is just static.

  # workflow_dispatch allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  # It can also be used from the Github API for external applications/scripts to trigger a workflow
  # The inputs context allows you to put in inputs when you run a workflow manually (reference via github.event.inputs)
  # They will appear when you hit the 'Run Workflow' buttons on the Action page, in a pop-up form format
  # Inputs can be customized into types to be required and have default values (see below for an example of each input type)
  # When a workflow is triggered (i.e. NOT manually), these inputs will be null if referenced.
