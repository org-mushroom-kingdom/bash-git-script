# Business: Example of using a workflow as a status check for a branch protection rule
# This particular status check applies to the team-luigi-rules ruleset, which requires all status checks to pass
# A status check in this context can be considered passing if the exit code returned is 0
# The check: For any PR whose target branch contains "team-luigi" (ex. team-luigi/v1.0) , the source branch must begin with "feature/team-luigi"

  # Allows manual runs--you can use a pre-determined fake branch name here.
