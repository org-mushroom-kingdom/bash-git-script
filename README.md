# bash-git-script

A repo for testing various Bash and Github related things, often tied together. This repo also tests Github Actions.

# Background Info

This repo is for testing CODEOWNERS, among other things. A sample organization had to be made due to this. Thus, this repo is owned by the organization **org-mushroom-kingdom**, which is split into four sample teams:

- team-mario
- team-luigi
- team-peach
- team-toad

A sample CODEOWNERS file has been made, with teams being assigned to various items within. Some items will purposefully NOT be in CODEOWNERS for testing purposes. 

# Github Actions

This repo also holds several Github Actions, which help automate various processes in the CI/CD workflow. 

In this repo, we will define actions into either *Business* or *Informative* categories. This designation will in the top comment of each workflow (see .github/workflows).  

TODO: Do something with this line --> Some of these actions are mainly informative and don't do much besides echo/print things. 
TODO: Put a table or something here in the readme that denotes which actions are business and which are informative. 

# Shell Scripts

As of 8-28-2025, the main shell script of note is main-script.sh. It shows how Bash works, how various Github commands work, and how Bash and Git can work together. It's the reason this repo is **called bash-git-script** in the first place. 

The main script is used for various things.

TODO 8-28-2025: Really, I should fork this repo, keep just the Bash and Bash-relevant stuff for portfolio and knowledge transer purposes, but I'm not doing that for a minute haha.
