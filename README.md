# bash-git-script

A repo for testing various Bash and Github related things, often tied together. Yay!

This repo is for testing CODEOWNERS, among other things. A sample organization had to be made due to this. Thus, this repo is owned by the organization org-mushroom-kingdom, which is split into four sample teams:

- team-mario
- team-luigi
- team-peach
- team-toad

A sample CODEOWNERS file has been made, with teams being assigned to various items within. Some items will purposefully NOT be in CODEOWNERS for testing purposes.
