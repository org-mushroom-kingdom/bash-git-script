9-13-25: Not to be confused with the top-level README. This README is in the 'docs' folder. Its full path is 'docs/README.md'
9-13-25: The 'docs/other' folder is more for example purposes at this point. I just needed something with a somewhat larger directory tree. 

Most of the files in the docs/other directory and its subfolders begin with "dummy"
The hint is in the name: They're dummy files, whose text will more or less state they are dummy files and where they are located.
